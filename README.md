# cu_riscv32i_cycle_accurate

For this project,I implemented a cycle accurate RISC-V from scratch.The project started with
learning the basics of assembly language programming and getting familiar with the online
codasip studio.I then created our very own extensive testing script on which to verify and
validate the future phase/parts of the project as and when we are implementing such. The
theoretical and the coding version gradually introduced me to the various concepts like
pipelining,hazard detection(control,structural etc.), forwarding and stalling mechanisms. I also
implemented various elements like adding,multiplying,xoring,loading etc. that are necessary for
a functional CPU.To enhance a smooth coding experience we had to draw the schematics ,
which helped us a lot with the coding aspect.This project was important because RISC-V is a
new ISA and most importantly it is open source . In the coming years it will definitely play a
critical role in all our careers and learning the nuances of it now will definitely help us in the
future.

**To view the schematics open the .xml file. I suggest trying to open via something online like draw.io 
***Testing files uploaded as well
